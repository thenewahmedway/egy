But the most common common factor is the constant feeling of extreme fatigue, and other symptoms that sufferers may suffer from are: shortness of breath, persistent cough, pain in the joints and muscles, problems with hearing and vision, headache, loss of sense of smell and taste, in addition to damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines. Affected persons may suffer from psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and difficulties with thinking. It is possible that these symptoms combine to destroy the lives of those who suffer from them. For example, says Jade Gray Christie, who suffers from this disease, I have never told a feeling of exhaustion as I feel today. Long-term Covid is not just a period of recovery for a patient after being in the intensive care ward for a while. Even those who develop a mild form of the disease may still face serious and long-term problems. Professor David Strain, from the University of Exeter in southern England who follows in the chronic fatigue syndrome clinic run by patients with this phenomenon, says: We have no doubt about the existence of a long-term Covid phenomenon."

The study showed that 87 percent of those were still suffering from at least one symptom, about two months after their discharge from hospital, while half of them complained of fatigue. But these studies focus on the minority who end up needing hospital treatment. By analyzing the results contained in the Covid Tracker App, which is used by about 4 million people in Britain, it was found that 12 percent of those infected with Covid-19 are still suffering from symptoms after 30 days. Obtaining it through the app - which has not yet been published - indicates that 1 in 50 sufferers experience symptoms after 90 days."

It is inferred that there is any relationship between the severity of infection with the virus and the exhaustion that sufferers continue to feel. But it is necessary to note that fatigue is not a symptom of long-term Covid. Professor Chris Breitling at the University of Leicester, who heads a project to track the identity of people with Covid-19, believes that Those who contract pneumonia due to their infection with the Coronavirus are more likely to contract long-term covid due to the damage to their lungs How does the virus cause long-term covid? There are many ideas and propositions, but there are no specific answers to this question, as it may be due to the virus remaining in small pockets despite its disappearance from most parts of the body.",
            "p2":"Professor Tim Spector at King's College London says that if the patient complains of long-term diarrhea, then you will find the virus in his intestine, and if he complains of a loss of smell, then the virus is still present in his nerves, it is possible that the survival of the virus is the basis of the problem. Coronavirus infects a wide range of cells in the body, which results in a strong immune response that in turn causes damage to the entire body. Some experts believe that the immune system does not return to its normal state after infection with Covid, and that this is the cause of the illness that many infected people feel after As they recover, infection with the virus may lead to changes in the functioning of various body systems, and this is clearly visible in the lungs if they become damaged. Long-term problems have already been seen in people with SARS and MERS, which are also caused by corona viruses, but Covid may also cause changes in the metabolism process, as there have been cases in which some people face great difficulties in controlling their blood sugar levels after they have had diabetes. As a result of their infection with Covid, SARS caused changes in the way the body represents fat that lasted for at least 12 years. There are initial indications of changes in the structure of the brain, but this topic is still subject to research. Covid 19 also causes strange changes in the blood, including Changes in coagulation and damage to blood vessels. Professor Straine told the BBC the theory that I am working on is that the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to different body tissues may age before their time. But he warns that unless we find the true cause of long-term Covid, it will be difficult to find an effective treatment for it."

I have followed the injured for 25 years, and I certainly hope that the sufferers will not continue to suffer from symptoms for more than one year, but I may be wrong. But there are concerns that although the injured people now seem to recover, they may face risks throughout their lives. For those who have had fatigue syndrome Chronic diseases may be infected again, and there are fears that future infections with Covid may also lead to an increase in those suffering from long-term Covid. And Professor Strain said if long-term Covid continues its current course, I expect many of the injured to recover, but if Another strain of the Corona virus has spread, and we will see this phenomenon spread every winter season.
